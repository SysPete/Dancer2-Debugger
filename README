DESCRIPTION
    Dancer2::Debugger makes using the excellent Plack::Debugger much more
    convenient and in addition provides a number of Dancer2 panels.

    Current panels included with this distribution:

    Plack::Debugger::Panel::Dancer2::Routes

    Some of the debugger panels make use of collectors which are imported
    into your Dancer2 app using Dancer2::Plugin::Debugger which is also
    included in this distribution.
